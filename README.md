**This repository may be unnecessary if the OWF InfoMapper software can use GeoTIFF in any coordinate reference system.**

This repository contains the [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](https://openwaterfoundation.org)
dataset files for East Troublesome Wildfire (2020) Burn Area Emergency Response (BAER).

This repository contains the workflow to download and process the BAER analysis
Soil Burn Severity (SBS)
into a GeoTIFF form that can be used for web visualization in Leaflet and the OWF InfoMapper software using
coordinate reference system EPSG:4326.

The dataset files are also published on
[`data.openwaterfoundation.org`](https://data.openwaterfoundation.org)
and are used in data analyses and web applications.

However, it is recommended to use the files served from the
[East Troublesome Wildfire (2020) BAER](https://data.openwaterfoundation.org/country/us/usfs/baer/2020/east-troublesome) dataset links.
